## 9. Big Five (final step)

**Not a multiple-choice question.** The survey ends with:
- A **link** to a free Big Five personality test (e.g. bigfive-test.com).
- **Score inputs** so they can record their results (O, C, E, A, N on a 0–100 scale; sliders or number fields). If their test uses 1–5, they multiply by 20.

**Access:** Students cannot use the rest of the app (dashboard, roommates, etc.) until both the lifestyle survey and Big Five scores are complete.

---

*All lifestyle questions have 5 word-option responses (no sliders). Sleep is split into bedtime and wake time; each includes "It depends". Big Five is the final step with link + score entry.*
